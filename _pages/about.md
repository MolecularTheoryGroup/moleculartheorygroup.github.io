This site is a collection of software tools and educational materials developed primarily by the Molecular Theory Group at Colorado School of Mines, and by the [Alexandrova lab](http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~ana/research.html) at the University of California, Los Angeles.

You'll find two main sections here:

1. **Research Tools**: Software packages for computational chemistry, biology, and materials science, each with detailed documentation, features, examples, and case studies demonstrating real-world applications.
2. **Educational Materials**: Textbooks, lecture notes, and other educational resources that resulted from original courses developed by the authors.

Browse the navigation menu to explore our tools and resources. Each research tool includes comprehensive documentation to help you get started and make the most of these computational resources.

**⚠️ This site is a work in progress. Please check back later for updates and new content.**
